# HelpDesk Working Group

The HelpDesk working group supports the critical goal of ensuring that participants consuming ModernApps Ninja program, courses and labguides have effective mechanisms to request assistance and recieve support for issues users may have. This includes identifying and/or implementing support channels such as slack channels, support email addresses, help desk features to ensure requests are monitored and attended to. The HelpDesk group will provide some direct support for users, but also works with other working groups to provide oversight to ensure different areas of the program have effective support channels.
