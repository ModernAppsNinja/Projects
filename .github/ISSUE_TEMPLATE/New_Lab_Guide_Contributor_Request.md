This Issue Ticket Type is for Individuals or Teams that want to develop a new Lab Guide. Submitting this ticket will result in a new Lab Guide repository with gitops automations and basic lab guide scaffolding.

This ticket should be used for requesting a single lab guide. If you would like to request multiple lab guide repositories, please open multiple tickets, one ticket per lab guide repository request. 

Before submitting this ticket, please create the lab guide ID for the lab guide you would like to develop. To create the lab guide ID, please visit the [PKS Ninja Data Models Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZhozDjFc5TGcbKe6a4PZ0EU4uYCWJ-ujuG2GTP0Agrk/edit#gid=373297956) and fill in the next available row with your requested course title, and fill in each blank field in the row following the row description in the first row of the spreadsheet. All fields that already have content will dynamically populate with the correct values for your lab guide or course.

After you have created your course ID, Please enter the value from the `RepoName` column below:

RepoName: enter_RepoName_here

Please Enter the Github ID(s) for any users that should have administrative permissions to approve merges to the lab guide repository:

- githubUserID1
- githubUserID2 (if applicable)

After you have submitted this issue ticket it will be reviewed and if approved a new Lab Guide repository will be provisioned for your course. Please allow up to a few days for the repository to be provisioned, or if you would like to expedite your request please feel free to contact Art Fewell via VMware Internal Slack or via VMware Code Slack.

Thank you for your contribution!
